* by intent, the game exposes a boundary that is an unsovable puzzle
  - the riddle is:
    ~ how do we make ourselves do things that don't feel good now,  that are good for us in the long term, and how do we stop doing things that feel good now that are bad for us in the long term
    ~ if the feeling are in control you will always do the later
    ~ you train the feelings to not be in control by bringing it to heel through meditation
    ~ in order to do the things that are good for you in the future, you have to somehow find motivation without feeling, because you dont know how something feels if you havent experienced it before
      * if a negative thing has happened in the past, you can rely on your feeling to tell you how youll feel if that same negative thing happens again. however if you want positive things to happen in the future, then you cant rely on your feelings, because your feelings can only come from imagination, and the less certain or powerful your imagination is, the less feeling you will generate for that future thing
