parents buffer young children from stress and serve as “co-regulators” of behavior and physiology
Over time, children raised by such parents gradually assume these regulatory capacities

Some parents cannot fill these roles. Children are vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a challenging environment. Although children can cope effectively with mild or moderate stress when supported by a caregiver, conditions that exceed their capacities to cope adaptively often result in problematic short- or long-term consequences.

young children are physically dependent, they remain psychologically dependent throughout childhood and adolescence

Children who have experienced abuse and neglect are therefore at increased risk for a number of problematic developmental, health, and mental health outcomes, including learning problems (e.g., problems with inattention and deficits in executive functions), problems relating to peers (e.g., peer rejection), internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), externalizing symptoms (e.g., oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, aggression), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As adults, these children continue to show increased risk for psychiatric disorders, substance use, serious medical illnesses, and lower economic productivity

not all children experience problematic outcomes, despite facing significant adversity in the form of abuse or neglect
