* game proliferated aliens by aliens reproducing
* aliens life will generally be on the decline from negative experiences
* the goal of the game is to make your aliens have as much of a long happy life for all people as much as possible
* if children have abusive environments then they will be heavily affected
* the traits of a parent can complement or exaserbate
* in theory, normal parents make good kids, traumatised parents make truamatised kids
* its game over when you go past the exponential threshold of no return (in terms of terrible people creating terrible people)
* random events reperesent represent a challenge in the childs developmental phase that could make the kid traumatised or stronger


* the game is designed to teach people
  - the wise idea is
    ~ having an answer to one of the most challenging concepts in human history, what is the nature of addiction
  - the game teaches you
    ~ if you are naive in life and you trust your instincts and feelings, then you will fall for the trap of addiction
    ~ as you play the game and lose, (as with every game), you think 'why did i lose, i thought i understood this game, let me try again and see if i can get a better understanding, let me try again i know i can do better'
      * as you play the game over and over, and you realise what works and what doesnt work, you advance in the game and get a higher score
      * the game deceives you by misleading you into thinking that you will do better at the game if you do it the complete wrong way, and as you realise the game is deceiving you, you start to play the mechanics of the game despite being misled

* you want your people to fuck so that the game continues
* shit people make shit people
* your goal is to make the game last as long as you can by making sure your civilisation doesnt disolve into antisocial apocolypse




* an aliens mood will fluctuate between high and low
  - if the aliens mood is low they will feel pain relative to their trauma
  - while they feel pain, there is a chance they will look for an outlet
  - the skill of the game is to help the alien find internal resources to weather the storm of the pain and become more resilient
    ~ you can help them think of different thoughts
    ~ you can send other aliens to give compassion
  - if the alien is in pain and finds a random way to feel better, based on the amount of instant gratification that person does, it will make the pain go away
  - the alien will then get an association with that thing to make them feel better
  - if they cant get the thing they want then they will go crazy
    ~ you can encourage aliens to get their happiness from a range of things not just 1

* the pain an adult experiences is relative to how much trauma they had as a child

* when the conscious mind tries to do something different, the subconscious mind will feel bad, sabotage your plan with negative perspective, and entice back to what it wants with positive perspective.
  - every time the subconscious mind tries to do something, its a wresting match between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind
