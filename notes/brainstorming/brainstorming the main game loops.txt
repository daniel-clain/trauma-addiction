* what is the cause or start of the chain of events
  - james lange theory
    ~ see stimulus
    ~ triggers subconscious response
    ~ subconscious state triggers emotion
  - things trigger to recall a memory of a past event
    ~ the more intense the event, the more chance there is of recalling it
  - when the thought is recalled, the emotion comes with it
  - the unconscious mind experiences the emotion, and assumes that the emotion inst a recollection, its thinks its actually happing now
  - so then there is a chain reaction, emotions and thoughts triggering the subconscious mind, the subconscious mind and the emotions are generating new thoughts, the new thoughts are recalling related negative memories, and the chain reaction perpetuates

* emotions for intense memories give the body and brain a rush of energy
  - people become addicted to the rush of those emotions(key)
  - people want to reaffirm that they cant solve the problem because that are addicted to the feeling of the rush of energy and feel something. they start brainwashing themselves with a negative limiting story so that they can trap themselves into being triggered and therefor getting their fix for feeling that rush of energy from the emotions
