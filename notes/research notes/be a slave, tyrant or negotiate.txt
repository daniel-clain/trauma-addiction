* we default to tyrany and slavery because that doesnt require any cognitive effort
* then we pretend everything is alright, but then it blows up in our faces
* we gotta learn how to negotiate
* you have to notice what you want, and you have to tell yourself what those things are

i want a job
good friends that respect me
stay at home and learn and create

* if you lay it out and negotiate, then you have 2 people moving in the same direction
  - the application of cognitive effort between the 2 of you will find a way forward where the net value is bigger than net value if they had not negotiated

* people dont admit what they want, because they are ashamed of it

* start with what you want, then negotiate and factor in all the opposing factors, decide on something that youre sure can be acomplished
