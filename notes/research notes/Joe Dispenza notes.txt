* a habit is a redundant set of automatic, unconscious, thoughts behaviors and emotions
  - they are acquired through repetition
  - a habit is when youve done something so many times that your body now nows how to do it better than your mind

* people thing about their problems, those problems are like circuits(memories) in the brain
  - each of those memories are connected to people and things at certain times and places
  - the memories happened in the past and they are thinking about those memories, so they are living in the past
  - each memory has associated emotions
    ~ the memory's strength is usually relative to the emotion's strength
    ~ memories are the product of past experiences

  - when people recall the memory, they recall they emotion, and so if the memory was of a bad thing like a problem, then they will feel the bad emotions, such as sadness, loneliness, anxiety

  - how you think and how you feel create your state of being, if you think of memories, then your thoughts and emotions will be relative to the past, and therefore your state of being will be in the past,  when heams your future will be your past, and therefore if you will be stuck in the past. 
    - to get unstuck, 
      ~ be aware that your habits are the start of failing system
      ~ be aware that the key is to do something different
      ~ be aware that this is your hardest challenge and requires strategised repetition
      ~ deny the old habbit
      ~ reherse your future 
        * the reason your memory's feelings are more powerful than your imagination's feelings is because you've already experienced your memories, and its very hard to experience your imagination
          - a better future doesnt exist in memories, it only exists in imagination
          - your imagination gives yourself the possibility to feel the feelings of events that have not actually happened
            ~ the more powerful your imagination, the more powerful the feeling

* you cant think greater than how you feel
  - in a sense, feeling have become the means of thinking
  - by definition of emotions, people think in the past


* routine becomes like a program, and people lose their free will to a program
  - when it comes time for change, the old routine is redundant and no longer practiced, however it is still coded there like a sub routine that could trigger based on relative experiences


* 95% of who we are by 35 is a set of habits, programs, sub routines, hard wired attitudes, beliefs and perceptions
  - 5% of your mind could have all these great plans, but because the body (subconscious system) is doing a whole different program and its too overwhelming for your 5% to overcome


* how do you make positive chances to counter this negative system
  - you have to get beyond the analytical mind
    ~ the analytical mind separates the conscious mind from the subconscious mind
  - change your brain waves, slow them down
  - when your train your subconscious mind that it is not in control then you are grated access to edit the programming of your mind
    ~ train your subconscious mind like a dog
      * tell it to sit and stay, 
      * once your dog has sat still for long enough, then he will learn that you are the master
      * when you dog is wild and doing whetever it wants you it uses a lot of energy, and you use a lot of energy trying to control it. but when your dog knows that your are the master, and when your dog is sitting and staying. then you will be granted access to the controls, and you will have a lot more focus and energy that you would have normaly used on the wild dog

* long term mermories are created from very highly emotional experiences


* people think within the circuitry of their experience, and they feel chemically within the boundaries of those emotions

* when you have an emotional reaction to someone or some thing, most people think they cant control that emotional reaction,
  - there is a refracted period, you can influence how long it lasts


* when people have an event, they keep recalling the event because of teh emotions of stress hormones, 
  - the survival emotions are saying pay attention to what happened because you wanna be prepared if it might happen again

* people who live in stress are always anticipating the worst case scenario based on a passed experience, and theyre literally out of the infitine potentials in teh quantum field, theyre selecting the worst possible outcome, and they begin to emotially embrace it with fear, theyre conditioning their body into a state of fear

* some people get to the point where they have random panic attacks that happen subconsciously where you cant predict it


* some people have fear about things that happenet to them a long time ago, and they havent been able to change biologically

* your body is the subconscious mind, it doesnt know the different between the experience thats creating the emotion that youre creating by thought alone


* memories are of the past 
  - memories create emotions, emotions create memories
  - as you feel and think, your whole state of being is in the past

* the hardest thing about change, is not making the choices you made the day before.
  - the moment you decide to make a different choice, get ready because its going to feel uncomfortable
  - the body (subconscious) puts up massive resistance, the body is in the unknown, and so the body wants to return back to whats familiar
  - the body will start influencing the mind
  - the body will provide you with sabotage thoughts
  - you will respond to those sabotage thougthts as though they are true, and feel the feelings and think the thoughts
  - the same experience produces the same emotion

* people constantly reafirm thier emotional state
  - when they wanna give up that emotion, the body is stronger than the mind because its been conditioned that way

* theyd rather feel guilt and suffering because at least they can predict it

* people need to self regulare their emotional state, independant on whats going on in the surrounding environment

* thinking about a bad thing make it worse cos you arouse negative brain waves. Arousal of stress hormomes makes you overly analytical

* the fundamental question is, how long are you going to react. any personw ill react, but a traumatised person will act too much

* matter doesnt create the field, field creates matter, if you change the vibe the change the field, and you change what is created

* if your not defined by a vision of yourself in the future then all your defined by is memories of your past

* the problem is people believe in thier past more than they believe in thier future

* the emotions you feel while under stress are 
  - anger, hostility, frustration, impatience, fear, anxiety, worry, guilt, shame, envy, jealousy, competition
  
* stress is when your brain and body are knocked out off balance

* teach people how to open their heart
- sustain elevated emotion
- if you sustain an a rhythm of elevated emotion, you will generate a field of energy

* if you field grows, it connects you to other

* you thought is the intention of the wave 

* 10 mins of gratitude a day is all you need to combat stress

* organisms can tolerate short term stress

* humans become addicted to stress

* when people keep thinking the same thought which cause anxiety or depression, that builds their environment to 

* activating different protiens is very good for you



* if you live in the past, soon, your future will become the past

* you cant think greater than how you feel

* theyve lost their free will to a program

* when routine (habit, cycle) becomes redundant, it becomes a subconscious program

* people function like a computer program, who we are is a memorised set of behaviors, emotional reactions, unconscious habits, hard wired attitudes, beliefs and perceptions

* to break out, you have to go beyond the analytical mind, this is where meditation comes in, meditation changes your brain waves by slowing them down and calming  them. when you do it properly, you enter the operating system, and how you are able to make really important changes

* most people wait for a horrible event before they decide to change, and the question is why wait
  - you can learn to change in a state of pain and suffering, or you can learn to change in a state of joy and inspiration
