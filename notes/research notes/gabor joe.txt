* brain systems we have in common with animals, lust, care, rage, seeking, panic & grief, fear, play, 
  - panic & greif when ur a young child and care isnt available
  - when parent doesnt respond to childs distress, alone when upset, child panic circuit = cry, 
  - good parents respond to cry
  - response to the environment
  - if parents dont respond, then the kid gets anxiety
* the wrong thought process is, the childs behaviour is causing the problem, so if you fix the behaviour you fix the problem
  - dont fix the behaviour by controling it
  - the opposits is true
  - if you pick it up when its distressed, you show them they dont have to be anxious
  - it doesnt entrench crying manipulating behaviour
  - adult needs to help regulate the childs 
  - you dont have to teach them to be independent
  - kids will copy the behaviour
  - parents need to meet the needs, then the child with mature with self regulation
  - if you don
