* addiction = sad life, lose everything, lose human relationship
* positive things are addicting - even things like love and connection
	- breast milk reduces separation distress
	- testosterone counteracts crying
* nothing shakes them from their addiction
* why are their addictions so powerful
	- they are afraid of life
* what is their person getting from addiction
	- give them a temporary sense of relief, peace, control, calmness
* why are these qualities missing from their lives, what happened to them
* addiction is a bout looking for oblivion, just not to be ourselves, its about the discomfort in ourselves
* 3 things people are afraid of, death, other people, their own mind
* people want to distract themselves from their own mind
	- shopping, sex, games, consumerism, internet, food
* definition of addiction
	- any behavior that gives you temporary relief, temporary pleasure, but in the long term causes harm, has some negative consequence, and you cant give it up despite those negative consequence
	
* you can never get enough, you can never fill this emptiness on the inside
* addiction is all about trying to fill that emptiness from the outside

* why are people in pain, you have to look at their lives (not their biology)
* highly addicted patients are in pain because they've been abused all their lives
	- they began life as an abused child
	- neglect, abandon, abused, emotionally hurt, over and over
* the brain develops an interaction with the environment
	- you can have a good environment or a bad environment
* drugs are not by themselves addictive
* some people are vulnerable, why the susceptibility
* endorphins make possible the experience of love
* endorphins are natural pain killing
* addiction acts on the endorphin system
* abused children don't develop the circuit for creating endorphins on the inside, therefore they rely on creating endorphins from the outside
* as adults they feel pain, and dont know how to relive it, but when they have drugs they feel normal, in a sense, they feel love for the first time
* abused people have an emptiness where love should be, and they try to fill it with drugs which are temporary, they can only fill it from within to be sustainable
* the emptiness always goes back to what we didn't get when we were very small
* rejecting drug addicts is ironic, they reject cos they see the addict as the same as themselves and they don't want to see themselves, they are scared to see the hypocrite in themselves so they proclaim the drug addict is 'different from me' and separates
