* prevents us from completing actions that we want to do
* it comes from my subconscious

* why does our subconscious make us feel resistance
  - its because out body has a concept of 'homeostasis', the body tries to keep its self in the balance between preset limits
  - if you want to do what you want do

* its uncomfortable because the old way has been the main way for so long. when you try to do something different, your subconscious fights to do things the old way

* resistance is a good thing, it helps you know what you want

* its usually not as bad as you think, your fear/pain usually exaggerates the problem
