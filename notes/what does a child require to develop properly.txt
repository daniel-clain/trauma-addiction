things child needs
  * love
    - spend time
  * bare necessities
    - food, shelter, medicine
  * encourage to play
    - helps them develop a desire to explore and learn about their surroundings
    - Playtime helps children be creative, learn problem-solving skills and learn self-control.
    - By playing with others, children discover their strengths and weaknesses, develop a sense of belonging, and learn how to get along with others
    - being involved and enjoying the activity. One of the most important questions to ask children is “Did you have fun?’’ not “Did you win?”
  * encourage, nurture, support
  * physical activity
    - generates good mental health
  * guidance and discipline
    - Be firm, but kind and realistic with your expectations. Children’s development depends on your love and encouragement.
      ~ Criticize the behavior, not the child. It is best to say, “That was a bad thing you did,” rather than “You are a bad boy or girl.”
    - Set a good example. You cannot expect self-control and self-discipline from a child if you do not practice this behavior.
    
  

things that need to be avoided
  * dishonesty
  * mean
  * intimidating
  * pain
  * use things as baby sitter, eg, computer
  * we often acknowledge only success and winning. This attitude can be discouraging and frustrating to children who are learning and experimenting with new activities. It’s more important for children to participate and enjoy themselves.
