* radical acceptance doesnt mean radical tolerance
  - get rid of the winging
  - acceptance that this is the way it is right now, where do we go from here 

  * the more we can investigate and understand, the more we can make friends with all aspects of ourselves
  - key to healing


* self acceptance, acceptance of the parts we have disowned including the emotional feelings we're not willing to feel

* conflict, direct vs fear of them taking it badly

* we dont react to what happens, we react to an interpretation of what happens
  
* dilema, if i fully express how i feel, i'll maybe hurt her or hurt the Relationship
  - but if i dont, then im not being authentic

* early childhood, 2 needs, 
  - attachment: need for attachment and closeness with another person for the sake of being taken care of, or for the sake of taking care of the other, care system to take care of the vulnerable (system in the brain designed to help us care)
  - grief & panic: what we expereince if we dont get care that comes with attachment

* human kids are more vulnerable than any other animal

* we have a need to be authentic
  - knowing ourself is an essential need

* dilema, i could be authentic, but then they're gonna exclude me
  - i could suppress my authenticity, and then ill have the attachment
  - authenticity gets sacrificed 100% of the time
    ~ sever mental and physical health implications
      - depression  ( means to push down )
        - its not inhereted brain disease
        - having to push down emotions as a child

* nobodys ever discovered a gene ( or group) for mental health condition
  - 

* gene for general menatal health
  - something is being inhereted but nothign specific
  - much more relative to the environment
  - what is being inhereted?
    ~ non diseases
    ~ sensitivity
      * if i tap myself on the shoulder, i dont feel pain. what if it was bare and there was a burn, thin skinned, now you feel sever pain. 
        - vulnerability being inhereted

* the more you feel when things go wrong, the more pain you feel

* if child is expressing anger, dont push away
  - instead help them to regulate

* good parenting = help give self regulation
  - depends on age, 
    ~ when 2, they want a cookie before dinner
      * you say no, they throw a tantrum
        - theres nothing wrong with a child throwing a tantrum
        - you say 'oh youre really angry arent you, you really want that cookie, and yoruea really mad at daddy cos he wont let you have the cookie'

* the immature circuits of the childs brain uses the mature circuits of the adults brain, to help regulate it
  - the way you help a child learn self regulation is by being regulated yourself
  -  if you stay calm, that will help the child develop self regulations
  -  hes downloading your circuits
  - if you respond with punishment or hostility, and give him the message that hes not acceptable, you're just frustrating him even more
