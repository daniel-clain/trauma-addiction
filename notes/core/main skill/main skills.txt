  - unenlightened way to do it
    ~ when your body encounters a pattern, it will bring back a memory
    ~ your memory will give you a default emotion
    ~ you will then apply that emotion to the pattern
    ~ the emotion and the pattern will give you a thought and you will think you know the rest of the pattern, so you adopt a thought that come from your memory, rather than try to treat the instance as new
  - enlightened way
    ~ know that your thought is based on your physiology, emotion, beliefs, experiences
    ~ acknowledge that many people would perceive the same situation differently
    ~ take the time to consider how other people might look at it
    ~ consider adopting a perspective that more helpful
    ~ learn to not go with the first perspective from emotional impulse
    ~ regain control with your conscious mind, choose a perspective that will help make your life better not worse
