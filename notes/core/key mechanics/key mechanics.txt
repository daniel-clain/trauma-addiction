* a stimulus can cause an emotional response

* when your aliens successfully bring up a great kid and it excells, then it leaves your town, and you get bonus points

* negative emotions are designed to improve out situation in negative situations
  - trauma is the corruption of this system

    ~ eg run faster
  - conscious experience
    ~ eg thinking something terrible is going to happen

* emotions can be short flashes or long and lingering

* excess pain = depression, suicidal ideation

* immediate threat causes flight or fight response

* challenges cause stress
  - if stress is too high
    ~ strong memory formed bound to strong current emotion
  - if challenged by stress too often
    ~ body doesnt get a chance to recover
    ~ body gets used to stress being normal state, this creates anxiety
  - if challenge is not too long and not too intense
    ~ person will not have a negative experience  
    ~ if they succeed at the problem, they will have a big good feeling
    ~ if they make progress with the problem they will have small good feeling

* kids will learn behavior from those around them

* when an alien has an encounter, if it triggers enough of a fear response, the alien will attack, be paralyzed or run


* when an alien encounters something that triggers a memory
  - the memory will tell you how to feel, and what to think
  - however, after spending time on the encounter, if the new encounter is a lot less than the memory, then the memory will have its associated memory reformed to the average of the last memory compared to the latest encounter
