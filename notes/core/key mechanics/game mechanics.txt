* as time passes, bad things will happen, the player has controls to intervene and influence the outcome to be better
* the player will be misled
  - the player has to have the skill to resist being misled

* a character will be at risk of developing an addiction, addictions ruin live and are almost impossible to reverse

* a child will be at risk of being abused as a child

* a person with abuse will be at risk of developing an addiction

* as you progress with the game, the challenge grows and becomes more detailed, more complex and more challenging
  - players can only unlock a higher level of challenge by beating the level of challenge theyre on


* the person has a chance to be triggered to feel pain
  - while they feel pain they have a chance to be triggered do something to counteract the pain
  - while they are looking for relif, there is a high chance they go for what they went for last time
  - if they go for what they went for last time they will have expectations: if i have x amount i will get x high
  - everytime they do the same relief, it:
    ~ increases the chance they do it again
    ~ increases the tolerance
    ~ increases their dopamine standard
  - the drug will always work as intended and relive the pain completely
  - the drug will only last for a certain period of time relative to tolerance
  - if an occurrence happens that triggers pain, then the cycle has a higher chance to repeat again

* different addictions have different mechanics
  - drugs have chance to be weak to strong, pure to low quality
  - drugs cost money
  - food makes you less capable, less sexual, less healthy, costs money
  - sex/porn addiction makes you more likely to have toxic sexual encounters
  - gaming addiction doesnt have strong reasons to fight against it, but it eats up so much of your time
  - Gambling addiction costs a lot of money
  - work addiction makes to have weak social encounters and takes up a lot of time

* from research, the addiction is not always relative to the abuse/truama, its like all trauma causes the same problem, a pain that cant be managed from withing, and all addiction is for the same reason, to feel a sense of relif and control. 
  - eg, i read on quora that 2 accounts, 1 girl had an addiction to heroin cos she was molested, the other girl had a gambling addiction and she was molested, but neither of them are molesters
