* when an alien does something, it is stored in its history
* each time an alien does a thing, they become more familiar, and less scared
* if a thing makes you feel good, you will remember how good it makes you feel
* when you want to feel good, you will think of the things that make you feel most good and do one
* you can only do so much of a thing before diminishing returns
  - you cant keep eating when ur full
  - you cant keep exercising when ur muscles are burned out
* you can go to far doing a thing
  - too much drugs = overdose
  - too much weed = green out
  - too anger = murder
  - too sad = suicide
  - too stressed = panic attack


Over time you build a tollerance to the thing, the negatives and positives are less pronounced
  - your memory of a huge positive or negative is still there, and each time you do the thing you're hoping it will be as good as you remember
    - if you fall too short of your expectation you fail, and you feel all of sad angry and stressed
  - they can get teh same high by having more, the cost and tollerance and adverse affect will go up
