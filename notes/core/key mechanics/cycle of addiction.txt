(its the way we deal with activating event that can put us into the cycle of addiction)

* activating event
  - small thing, eg stubbing ur toe, parking ticket
  - big thing, job loss, break up, death
* all activating events will product uncomfortable feelings
  - sadness, anger, insecurities, anxiety
* uncomfortable feelings lead to need to escape
  - how people cope is with nal adapted coping behavior
* maladapted coping behaviors are from childhood
  - lack of discipline of limits when a kid
  - lack of learning from others
  - learning bad things from others (eg tv)
* the escape (avoidance) is always temporary
* when other forms of escape and avoidance are ineffective, people turn to drugs
* drugs often cause negative consequences
  - relationship issues
  - losing a job
  - financial loss
  - legal implication
* the negative consequences lead to shame and guilt
* shame and guilt is an activating events
  - and thus, this is a cycle


The solution
  * pull yourself out of the negative activating event
    - put yourself in rehab or treatment center
  * in rehab they learn about activating events
  * be able to learn and own the feelings associated with activating events
  * instead of escape, learn about healthy comping mechanisms
  * relapse is a part of recovery
  * when the bad feeling come, be proactive, not reactive, stay vigalent and take care of yourself without looking to external things
